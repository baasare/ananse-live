The model was tested with variations in three conditions trees acclimated and unacclimated to their wind environment three levels of gust strength and three tree planting densities. The ABM was able to replicate damage patterns and demonstrate damage propagation within the forest and the effects of forest edges.

2-s2.0-85060335373,"Many studies of ecological disturbance highlight the unexpected impact that compounded disturbances have on communities. One of the well-studied mechanisms by which forest wind and fire disturbances interact is that wind damage increases flammable fuels—amplifying the effects of fire—leading to unexpected changes in vegetation composition. However, wind disturbance may also buffer the effects of fire through mechanisms such as disrupting fuel continuity. The extent to which wind and fire disturbances buffer, or reduce, the magnitude of ecological change has been less well studied. In this study, we winched trees in a Pinus taeda L. forest to simulate wind damage in experimental plots and combined this treatment with prescribed fire. This design allowed investigation of how forest regeneration responds to combinations of wind and fire disturbance, with particular emphasis on whether disturbance interactions were amplifying or buffering. We also tested for evidence of two mechanisms of disturbance interaction that are expected to buffer the cumulative ecological impact of wind and fire disturbances, testing  whether wind damage increased resprouting response following fire and  whether seedlings on tip-up mounds were protected from fire. We identified evidence for a combination of disturbance interactions occurring in both an amplifying direction e.g., rapid recruitment and establishment of Rhus copallinum as well as interactions occurring in a buffering direction e.g., increased resilience in resprouting saplings in winched plots. Such varying responses may lead to a heterogeneous mixture of amplifying and buffering effects following compounded disturbances, such that at the stand scale, the aggregate regeneration response of two disturbances is the net effect of these individual interaction mechanisms. The results of this study highlight that mechanisms of disturbance interactions may vary spatially and temporally and may be best understood by considering factors such as disturbance severity, species life history traits, and timing between disturbances.   Elsevier B.V.Interactions between wind and fire disturbance in forests Competing amplifying and buffering effects",Interactions between wind and fire disturbance in forests: Competing amplifying and buffering effects,"Many studies of ecological disturbance highlight the unexpected impact that compounded disturbances have on communities. One of the well-studied mechanisms by which forest wind and fire disturbances interact is that wind damage increases flammable fuels—amplifying the effects of fire—leading to unexpected changes in vegetation composition. However, wind disturbance may also buffer the effects of fire through mechanisms such as disrupting fuel continuity. The extent to which wind and fire disturbances buffer, or reduce, the magnitude of ecological change has been less well studied. In this study, we winched trees in a Pinus taeda L. forest to simulate wind damage in experimental plots and combined this treatment with prescribed fire. This design allowed investigation of how forest regeneration responds to combinations of wind and fire disturbance, with particular emphasis on whether disturbance interactions were amplifying or buffering. We also tested for evidence of two mechanisms of disturbance interaction that are expected to buffer the cumulative ecological impact of wind and fire disturbances, testing (1) whether wind damage increased resprouting response following fire and (2) whether seedlings on tip-up mounds were protected from fire.

In , an ice storm damaged forest canopies and led to increased hydrologic losses of nitrogen N from the northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest HBEF, a Long-Term Ecological Research LTER site in New Hampshire, USA. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying this response, we experimentally simulated ice storms with different frequencies and severities at the small plot scale. We took measurements of plant and soil variables before  and after ,  treatments using the same methods used in  with a focus on hydrologic and gaseous losses of reactive N, as well as rates of soil N cycle processes. Nitrogen cycle responses to the treatments were insignificant and less marked than the responses to the  natural ice storm. Pools and leaching of inorganic N, net and gross mineralization and nitrification and denitrification rates, and soil to atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide NO were unaffected by the treatments, in contrast to the  storm which caused marked increases in leaching and watershed export of inorganic N.

In 1998, an ice storm damaged forest canopies and led to increased hydrologic losses of nitrogen (N) from the northern hardwood forest at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), a Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in New Hampshire, USA. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying this response, we experimentally simulated ice storms with different frequencies and severities at the small plot scale. We took measurements of plant and soil variables before (2015) and after (2016, 2017) treatments using the same methods used in 1998 with a focus on hydrologic and gaseous losses of reactive N, as well as rates of soil N cycle processes. Nitrogen cycle responses to the treatments were insignificant and less marked than the responses to the 1998 natural ice storm. Pools and leaching of inorganic N, net and gross mineralization and nitrification and denitrification rates, and soil to atmosphere fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O) were unaffected by the treatments, in contrast to the 1998 storm which caused marked increases in leaching and watershed export of inorganic N. The difference in response may be a manifestation of N oligotrophication that has occurred at the HBEF over the past 30 years.

Neither mammal community composition, nor individual mammal species, differed between unmined forest and restoration but reptile communities did and some reptile species were significantly less abundant in restoration than in unmined forest.

The unique Hg isotopic signatures of Amazonian soils probably result in multistep fractionation processes during pedogenesis (millions of years) and in a potentially different Hg isotopic signature of preanthropogenic background GEM. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Article,"Guédron S., Amouroux D., Tessier E., Grimaldi C., Barre J., Berail S., Perrot V., Grimaldi M.","Univ.

The main objective of this study was to determine how two completely different reforestation techniques in windthrow areas impact net ecosystem production NEP of this Scots pine forest ecosystem under similar meteorological conditions. The two techniques were conventional “Tlen I” site uprooted stumps pulled out and removed from the site followed by ploughing, and non-conventional “Tlen II” site all stumps left on the site to decompose with no ploughing. Therefore, we measured carbon dioxide CO fluxes using the eddy covariance EC technique for four continuous years.

However, the Tlen I conventional technique lost over  less C than Tlen II during the – observation period. In contrast to existing knowledge, ploughing as done at Tlen I, did not substantially increase CO emission, as compared to local soil ripping non-conventional technique. The decrease in net C emission, estimated on the basis of linear model parameters, was almost five times greater at Tlen I than at Tlen II.

In Alberta, Canada, boreal anthropogenic disturbances from in situ oil exploration are increasing forest fragmentation, especially in the form of exploratory well pads and seismic lines i.e., linear forest clearings created during the exploration phase of oil extraction. Dissection of these forests by seismic lines has the potential to change local patterns in wind and light, and thus may alter forest communities.

Here we investigated changes in light and wind on seismic lines compared to that of adjacent undisturbed forests and nearby cleared openings. Specifically, we examined how seismic line characteristics i.e., line direction, line width, and adjacent canopy height altered local responses in these abiotic conditions. Generalized Linear Mixed Effect models predicted a -fold increase in average light intensity and maximum wind speeds, and a -fold increase in average wind speeds on seismic lines compared to adjacent forests.

Using tree demographic data from four large, tropical forest dynamics plots that differ in cyclonic storm frequency, we compare tree population and community dynamics. Additionally, we assess the effect of cyclonic storms on three functional traits, specific leaf area, wood density, and tree height of the dynamic tree assemblages. Mortality, growth and recruitment rates and the intrinsic rates of population growth of species differed across the plots, and were most dynamic, especially for stems - cm in diameter, at the plot which had an intermediate level of cyclonic storm frequency. Functional assemblages of species had the greatest degree of temporal variation in relation to disturbance, as measured by the change in functional divergence for the two plots with more intermediate cyclonic storm recurrence. Therefore, cyclonic storms affecting these plots generally have a greater effect on forest composition and dynamism than comparable cyclonic storms do on the plot which experiences cyclonic storms more frequently. Thus, we provide some evidence that community-wide demographic resistance to cyclonic storms is generally lower at an intermediate frequency of storms. While cyclonic storm strength and timing are important determinants of the within forest variation in tree dynamics and functional trait assemblages, we also show that cyclonic storm timing and frequency shapes tropical forest dynamics and functional composition across forests. We conclude that, over a given time interval, sites with intermediate levels of damaging cyclonic wind disturbance express a greater potential for life-history variation in the forest community, when compared to sites with less or more frequent disturbance.   by the authors.The frequency of cyclonic wind storms shapes tropical forest dynamism and functional trait dispersion",The frequency of cyclonic wind storms shapes tropical forest dynamism and functional trait dispersion,"As cyclonic wind storms (hurricanes and typhoons) increase in frequency and intensity with climate change, it is important to understand their effects on the populations and communities of tropical trees they impact.

The objective of this study was to estimate individual and coupled effects of droughts and wind-storms on adult tree mortality across a -year period in  managed, mixed coniferous forest stands from the Western Alps and the Jura mountains. For each stand, yearly mortality was inferred from management records, yearly drought from interpolated fields of monthly temperature, precipitation and soil water holding capacity, and wind-storms from interpolated fields of daily maximum wind speed. We performed a thorough model selection based on a leave-one-out cross-validation of the time series. We compared different critical wind speeds CWSs for damage, wind-storm, and stand variables and statistical models. We found that a model including stand characteristics, drought, and storm strength using a CWS of  ms− performed the best across most stands. Using this best model, we found that drought increased damage risk only in the most southerly forests, and its effect is generally maintained for up to  years. Storm strength increased damage risk in all forests in a relatively uniform way. In some stands, we found positive interaction between drought and storm strength most likely because drought weakens trees, and they became more prone to stem breakage under wind-loading. In other stands, we found negative interaction between drought and storm strength, where excessive rain likely leads to soil water saturation making trees more susceptible to overturning in a wind-storm. Our results stress that temporal data are essential to make valid inferences about ecological impacts of disturbance events, and that making inferences about disturbance agents separately can be of limited validity. Under projected future climatic conditions, the direction and strength of these ecological interactions could also change.

Indirect evidence suggests that fragmentation increases risk of wind damage in tropical forests, but no studies have found such impacts following severe storms. In this study, we ask whether fragmentation and forest type old vs. second growth were associated with variation in wind damage after a severe convective storm in a fragmented production landscape in western Amazonia. We applied linear spectral unmixing to Landsat  imagery from before and after the storm, and combined it with field observations of damage to map wind effects on forest structure and biomass. We also used Landsat  imagery to map land cover with the goals of identifying old- and second-growth forest and characterizing fragmentation. We used these data to assess variation in wind disturbance across , ha of forest, distributed over , patches. We find that fragmentation is significantly associated with wind damage, with damage severity higher at forest edges and in edgier, more isolated patches. Damage was also more severe in old-growth than in second-growth forests, but this effect was weaker than that of fragmentation.

Through the comparison between the Model 2, Model 4, SVM (support vector machine) and MLC (maximum likelihood classification) classification result respectively, the study indicates that the random forest algorithm based on grid-search parameter optimization can achieve the classification accuracy of 88.16% in the multi-feature variables frame. After different methods are used to reduce the dimension of variables, the classification accuracy can also be kept above 85%, and the accuracy is higher than SVM and MLC classification results under the same number of feature variables. The random forest classifier is superior to SVM and more capable of dealing with multidimensional characteristic variables. The random forest method based on grid-search can obtain high precision in land use classification applied in reclamation area. Based on this method, remote sensing image interpretation can well provide the technical support and rational reference for land reclamation monitoring and supervision. © 2017, Editorial Department of the Transactions of the Chinese Society of Agricultural Engineering.

We monitored and manipulated quantitatively the strain regimes of  pairs of beech Fagus sylvatica trees of contrasting social status in an acclimated stand, and quantified the effects of these regimes on the radial growth over a vegetative season. Trees exposed to artificial bending, the intensity of which corresponds to the strongest wind-induced strains, enhanced their secondary growth by at least . Surprisingly, this reaction was even greater - relatively - for suppressed trees than for dominant ones. Acclimated trees did not sense the different types of wind events in the same way.

We monitored and manipulated quantitatively the strain regimes of 15 pairs of beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees of contrasting social status in an acclimated stand, and quantified the effects of these regimes on the radial growth over a vegetative season. Trees exposed to artificial bending, the intensity of which corresponds to the strongest wind-induced strains, enhanced their secondary growth by at least 80%. Surprisingly, this reaction was even greater - relatively - for suppressed trees than for dominant ones. Acclimated trees did not sense the different types of wind events in the same way. Daily wind speed peaks due to thermal winds were filtered out. Thigmomorphogenesis was therefore driven by intense storms. Thigmomorphogenesis is also likely to be involved in determining social status. © 2016 New Phytologist Trust.",Fagus sylvatica L.

The among-fires analysis showed that fires in less arid climates and with steeper slopes had more extreme severity. In less arid conditions there was more crown fuel accumulation and closer forest structures, promoting high vertical and horizontal fuel continuity and extreme fire severity. The analyses carried out for each fire separately within fires showed more extreme fire severity in areas in northern aspects, with steeper slopes, with high crown biomass and in climates with more water availability. In northern aspects solar radiation was lower and fuels had less water limitation to growth which, combined with steeper slopes, produced more extreme severity.

In recent decades, large tracts of northeastern boreal forest of Canada have been affected by different types of climatic events causing a lot of partial and some total stand mortality. Since these disturbances may become more important drivers of forest dynamics, there is a need to document their impact on forest structure. The objectives of this study were to describe temporal dynamics of partial windthrows and determine the effect of partial windthrow on stand composition and understory vegetation. The study was conducted in the North-Shore region of Quebec Canada. Eighteen plots in closed forests were paired with  adjacent windthrow areas, in which trees experienced similar edaphic and climatic conditions. Dendroecological analyses, combined with vegetation sampling, were conducted on each site to determine stand structure and vegetation development through time. Significant increases in balsam fir and shade-tolerant species were observed in windthrow gaps. Tree mortality in windthrown stands was a slow process until the mid-s, a period during which spruce budworm defoliation may have played a role in weakening trees and making them more vulnerable to partial windthrow. Greater mortality observed following the mid-s was most certainly related to a regional storm. The initial composition of stands plays an important role in driving postwindthrow succession, as balsam fir is more susceptible to treefall. As opposed to stand-replacing windthrow and spruce budworm outbreaks that generate various postdisturbance responses, partial windthrow appears to only create opportunities for pre-established balsam fir to undergo release in gaps.  , National Research Council of Canada.

The study was conducted in the North-Shore region of Quebec (Canada). Eighteen plots in closed forests were paired with 18 adjacent windthrow areas, in which trees experienced similar edaphic and climatic conditions. Dendroecological analyses, combined with vegetation sampling, were conducted on each site to determine stand structure and vegetation development through time. Significant increases in balsam fir and shade-tolerant species were observed in windthrow gaps. Tree mortality in windthrown stands was a slow process until the mid-1990s, a period during which spruce budworm defoliation may have played a role in weakening trees and making them more vulnerable to partial windthrow. Greater mortality observed following the mid-1990s was most certainly related to a regional storm. The initial composition of stands plays an important role in driving postwindthrow succession, as balsam fir is more susceptible to treefall. As opposed to stand-replacing windthrow and spruce budworm outbreaks that generate various postdisturbance responses, partial windthrow appears to only create opportunities for pre-established balsam fir to undergo release in gaps. © 2014, National Research Council of Canada.

We tested the hypothesis that the storm had deflected sites from the wider national trajectory of an increase in woody basal area and reduced understorey species-richness associated with ageing canopies and declining woodland management.

We analysed ecological changes between 1971 and 2002 in 143 200-m2 plots in 10 woodland sites exposed to the storm with an ecologically equivalent sample of 150 plots in 16 non-exposed sites. Comparing both years, understorey plant species-richness, species composition, soil pH and woody basal area of the tree and shrub canopy were measured. We tested the hypothesis that the storm had deflected sites from the wider national trajectory of an increase in woody basal area and reduced understorey species-richness associated with ageing canopies and declining woodland management. We also expected storm disturbance to amplify the background trend of increasing soil pH, a UK-wide response to reduced atmospheric sulphur deposition. Path analysis was used to quantify indirect effects of storm exposure on understorey species richness via changes in woody basal area and soil pH. By 2002, storm exposure was estimated to have increased mean species richness per 200 m2 by 32%. Woody basal area changes were highly variable and did not significantly differ with storm exposure. Increasing soil pH was associated with a 7% increase in richness. There was no evidence that soil pH increased more as a function of storm exposure. Changes in species richness and basal area were negatively correlated: a 3.4% decrease in richness occurred for every 0.1-m2 increase in woody basal area per plot. Despite all sites substantially exceeding the empirical critical load for nitrogen deposition, there was no evidence that in the 15 years since the storm, disturbance had triggered a eutrophication effect associated with dominance of gaps by nitrophilous species.

From a total of , individuals,  species were identified. The highest total abundance mean was recorded in FIR stands followed by NEX and EXT stands and, surprisingly, the lowest in REF stands. The highest total species richness was observed in REF stands, followed by NEX stands and FIR stands and the lowest in EXT stands. In REF and NEX stands, the most abundant species were Folsomia penicula and Tetracanthella fjellbergi, while in heavily damaged stands, the most abundant was Anurophorus laricis. The ordination method used demonstrated a significant influence of treatment on the abundance of Collembola. ANOVA used confirmed significant differences for all dominant species between treatments. The present study shows the negative impact of windthrow on Collembola communities as reflected in decreased species richness and abundance. However, disturbance by fire caused a considerable increase in collembolan abundance  years after the event.

The study focused on the impact of these disturbances and forestry practices on collembolan community distribution and structure 4 years after the disturbance. Four different treatments were selected for this study: intact forest stands (REF), non-extracted windthrown stands (NEX), clear-cut windthrown stands (EXT) and burnt windthrown stands (FIR). From a total of 7,820 individuals, 72 species were identified. The highest total abundance mean was recorded in FIR stands followed by NEX and EXT stands and, surprisingly, the lowest in REF stands. The highest total species richness was observed in REF stands, followed by NEX stands and FIR stands and the lowest in EXT stands. In REF and NEX stands, the most abundant species were Folsomia penicula and Tetracanthella fjellbergi, while in heavily damaged stands, the most abundant was Anurophorus laricis. The ordination method used demonstrated a significant influence of treatment on the abundance of Collembola. ANOVA used confirmed significant differences for all dominant species between treatments. The present study shows the negative impact of windthrow on Collembola communities as reflected in decreased species richness and abundance. However, disturbance by fire caused a considerable increase in collembolan abundance 3 years after the event. Moreover, we show that clearing of windthrown spruce forests after a windstorm is less favourable for communities of soil collembolans and slows down the recovery process. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Clearing; Collembola; Disturbance; High Tatra Mts; Wildfire; Windthrow,Article,"Čuchta P., Miklisová D., Kováč L.","Institute of Biology and Ecology, Faculty of Science, P.

The loss of nests was significantly higher in the first and second years following the disturbance than in the third year. The three species studied exhibited great tolerance to the short-term effects of the storm since we found no differences in density or reproductive parameters between the nine breeding seasons prior to the disturbance and the three which immediately followed it.

We used aerial photo interpretation and dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of wind, insect, and fire disturbances across a topographically complex landscape.

Windthrow patches ranged in size from . ha to . ha minimum .. ha, mean .. ha, maximum . ha.

However, the role of natural disturbances in shaping European mountain forest ecosystems has not been adequately studied, possibly because of the perception that the development of most European forests is primarily shaped by human influences and/or fine-scale gap-phase dynamics.In the present study, we investigate the long-term disturbance history of old protected forest dominated by Norway spruce in the Parangalitsa Reserve, Bulgaria. We used aerial photo interpretation and dendroecological methods to reconstruct the history of wind, insect, and fire disturbances across a topographically complex landscape. Over the past 150. years wind has been the most important disturbance agent in this ecosystem and at least 18% of the forested area shows evidence of high-severity blowdowns. Windthrow patches ranged in size from <1. ha to >10. ha (minimum 0.11. ha, mean 0.16. ha, maximum 10. ha). Although small disturbances were much more frequent, few larger blowdowns accounted for most of the disturbed area. Pure coniferous and single-cohort coniferous forest patches were more affected by blowdowns than mixed coniferous-deciduous and multi-cohort coniferous forest patches.

We tested two postulates  the spatial distribution of bats is affected by sizes of forest gaps created by natural disturbances and  species-specific responses can be predicted from bat ecomorphological traits aspect ratio AR and wingtip shape index WT that influence bat flight ability. We found that sizes of forest gaps affected the occurrence of each bat species and species richness of bats at local scales species-specific responses were related to the ecomorphological traits of individual species. Bat species with high AR and low WT were not affected by variation in canopy gap size. In contrast, bat species with low AR and high WT responded negatively to gap size, and those with intermediate AR and WT responded positively to canopy gap size at sites with small-sized gaps but responded negatively to large-sized gaps.

We wanted to know how environmental conditions and ecosystem processes change through time after bamboo flowering and if bamboo die-back would favor regeneration of canopy trees. Twenty  × . m plots of flowering and non-flowering bamboo were permanently marked and vegetation dynamics as well as nutrient cycling and microclimate studies were performed. C. ramosissima die-back enhanced growth and reduced mortality rate of tree saplings during the first year after flowering. Only growth of tree saplings previously established was enhanced by the flowering event and tree-species richness and saplings abundance of canopy trees did not change as expected due to bamboo flowering. The short-term effect of tree saplings growth was likely due to incident solar radiation at the forest floor which doubled in the first year after the bamboo flowering event. Increased light availability at the forest floor simultaneously promoted the growth of other understory plants such as ferns, lianas and Piper spp. that rapidly colonized gaps and intercepted a percentage of the incident solar radiation after the first year, which together with an increased litter layer due to the senescence of the bamboo, may have inhibited establishment of new tree individuals and affected tree growth. Contrary to predictions, soil water, litter decomposition and soil nutrients were not significantly affected by bamboo flowering. Thus, successful tree regeneration in gaps following bamboo flowering appears to be restricted to a very narrow window of increased light availability i.e., . year before growth of other understory plants and rapid re-colonization of bamboo.

Moderate-severity natural disturbances followed by moderate-intensity salvaging may have little detrimental effect on forest regeneration and diversity in these systems; the ecological surprises and threshold compositional change are more likely after combinations of natural and anthropogenic disturbances that have a much greater cumulative severity. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.",Diversity; Salvage; Wind disturbance; Wind severity; Woody plant regeneration,Article,"Peterson C.J., Leach A.D.","Department of Plant Biology, 2502 Plant Science Building, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, United States; Department of Cellular Biology, 724 Biological Sciences Building, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, United States",Scopus,2008,18,2,407,420,10.1890/07-0603.1,English,Scopus

2-s2.0-34250203584,"The effects of soil disturbance caused by the uprooting of a single or a few canopy trees on species richness and composition of vascular plant species and bryophytes were examined in a temperate beech forest Fagus sylvatica in northern Germany. We recorded the vegetation in  pairs of disturbed and adjacent undisturbed plots and established a chronosequence of mound ages to study the effect of time since microsite formation on plant species richness and composition. We found significant differences in plant species richness and composition between disturbed and adjacent undisturbed plots. Species richness of both vascular plants and bryophytes was higher in the disturbed than in the undisturbed plots, but these differences were more pronounced for bryophytes. We suggest that three main factors are responsible for this differential response. The availability of microsites on the forest floor that are suitable for the recruitment of bryophytes is lower than for vascular plants. Establishment of bryophytes in disturbed microsites is favoured by a greater abundance of propagules in the close vicinity and in the soil of the disturbed microsites, as well as by a greater variety of regeneration strategies in bryophytes than in vascular plants. Time since mound formation was a major factor determining plant species richness and composition. A significant decrease in the mean number of species was found from young mounds to intermediate and old mounds. However, differences were observed between vascular plants and bryophytes in the course of changes through time in species richness and composition. A large number of exclusive and infrequent vascular plant species was observed on young mounds, among them several disturbance specialists. We suggest that the establishment of many vascular plant species was infrequent and short-lived due to unfavourable light conditions and a low abundance of propagules. By contrast, the development of a litter layer was the main reason for the decreased mean number of bryophytes on old mounds. Our study supports the view that groups of species differing in important life history traits exhibit different responses to soil disturbance.

We found significant differences in plant species richness and composition between disturbed and adjacent undisturbed plots. Species richness of both vascular plants and bryophytes was higher in the disturbed than in the undisturbed plots, but these differences were more pronounced for bryophytes. We suggest that three main factors are responsible for this differential response. The availability of microsites on the forest floor that are suitable for the recruitment of bryophytes is lower than for vascular plants. Establishment of bryophytes in disturbed microsites is favoured by a greater abundance of propagules in the close vicinity and in the soil of the disturbed microsites, as well as by a greater variety of regeneration strategies in bryophytes than in vascular plants. Time since mound formation was a major factor determining plant species richness and composition. A significant decrease in the mean number of species was found from young mounds to intermediate and old mounds. However, differences were observed between vascular plants and bryophytes in the course of changes through time in species richness and composition. A large number of exclusive and infrequent vascular plant species was observed on young mounds, among them several disturbance specialists. We suggest that the establishment of many vascular plant species was infrequent and short-lived due to unfavourable light conditions and a low abundance of propagules. By contrast, the development of a litter layer was the main reason for the decreased mean number of bryophytes on old mounds. Our study supports the view that groups of species differing in important life history traits exhibit different responses to soil disturbance. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Bryophytes; Fagus sylvatica; Pits and mounds; Small-scale disturbance; Tree uprooting; Vascular plant species,Article,"Von Oheimb G., Friedel A., Bertsch A., Härdtle W.","Institute of Ecology and Environmental Chemistry, University of Lüneburg, Scharnhorststr. 1, 21335 Lüneburg, Germany",Scopus,2007,191,1,47,65,10.1007/s11258-006-9213-5,English,Scopus

We used a simulation model to evaluate forest succession, forest structure and the protective effect in subalpine blowdown areas after  simulation years under different scenarios. The scenarios included the effects of different management strategies such as clearing the fallen logs or leaving the sites untouched ""uncleared"", variations in seed supply, and ungulate browsing. The simulation results indicated that forest structure was heterogeneous after  years, with a high amount of trees between  and  cm height, and a low amount of trees taller than  m. The number of trees  m, which is important for the protective effect of a site, was lower at uncleared areas if the area was covered with high amounts of fallen logs, but diversity of microsites was higher than at cleared areas. We found that it is particularly important that abundant seed supply occurs within the first few years after the blowdown at cleared sites, because in later stages there was high competition by tall herbs, which prevented the establishment of tree regeneration. Larger time lags between seed years in the simulations led to retarded tree regeneration. Particularly at cleared sites, ungulate browsing retarded tree regeneration. In contrast, uncleared sites had a higher potential to recover from high browsing pressure due to a high amount of favourable microsites that are provided by decaying logs. These results of our model simulations may help understanding the dynamics of forest regeneration and providing perspectives for management after blowdown events.   Elsevier B.V.

We integrated an empirically parameterized, mechanistic model of windstorm mortality WINDSTORM and a seed-mass-based dispersal and recruitment model into a spatially explicit, individual tree model of forest dynamics SORTIE in order to create simulated long-term experiments designed to explore the sensitivity of forest composition and structure to species-specific resistance to and recovery from disturbance.  We found that species-specific variation in resistance to wind mortality interacted strongly with i shade tolerance characteristics, ii the medium-term history of disturbances, iii the long-term average severity of the disturbance regime and iv seedbed substrate dynamics to influence tree population dynamics and successional trajectories.  We also examined how local and long-distance dispersal affect response to wind disturbance. Ignoring differences among local dispersal characteristics overestimates the importance of dispersal-limited species. Our results show that long-distance immigration maintains species coexistence only if the immigration rate is very high relative to local dispersal. Despite this, stand-scale models that ignore long-distance dispersal can underestimate population dynamics of dispersal-limited species.  Our results indicate that landscape-scale heterogeneity in structure and species composition in these forests is facilitated by synergisms between the stochastic nature of wind disturbance and complex interactions between species traits that govern i resistance to disturbance, ii local dispersal and seedling establishment and iii competitive i.e. growthsurvival traits that do not adhere to strict tradeoffs.  We conclude that wind disturbance has much more complex and variable effects on long-term dynamics of forest structure and composition than suggested by previous models.

Visual damage estimates in  plots and corresponding reflectance and environmental data were divided into multiple, mutually exclusive training and reference datasets for damage classification evaluation. Damage classification accuracy was compared among four methods multiple regression, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood, and neural networks. Using the best classifier, various stratification methods were assessed for potential inflationary effects on classification accuracy due to spatial proximity between training and reference data. Of the classifiers that were evaluated, neural networks performed best. Neural networks learn training data accurately  overall, but classify proximate reference data less accurately , and distant, spatially independent reference data least accurately . Results indicate that, while remotely sensed and environmental data cannot discriminate among many levels of deciduous ice storm damage, they can by considered useful for differentiating areas of low to medium damage from areas of severe damage  accuracy.

Visual damage estimates in 104 plots and corresponding reflectance and environmental data were divided into multiple, mutually exclusive training and reference datasets for damage classification evaluation. Damage classification accuracy was compared among four methods: multiple regression, linear discriminant analysis, maximum likelihood, and neural networks. Using the best classifier, various stratification methods were assessed for potential inflationary effects on classification accuracy due to spatial proximity between training and reference data. Of the classifiers that were evaluated, neural networks performed best. Neural networks 'learn' training data accurately (94% overall), but classify proximate reference data less accurately (65%), and distant, spatially independent reference data least accurately (55%). Results indicate that, while remotely sensed and environmental data cannot discriminate among many levels of deciduous ice storm damage, they can by considered useful for differentiating areas of low to medium damage from areas of severe damage (69% accuracy).

Two stormflow hydrographs were selected and, based on 18O and Si, chemically separated into three flow components. Their sources were defined using mixing diagrams. Additional information about stormflow generating mechanisms was derived from recession analyses of the basin's complete 5-year hydrograph record. By providing insight into storage properties and residence times of outflowing reservoirs of the basin, recession analysis proved to be a valuable tool in runoff model conceptualization. Its results agreed well with hydrometric and hydrochemical data. Supported by evaluation of 30 hillslope soil profiles a coherent concept of stormflow generation could be derived: whereas in many steeply sloped basins in the temperature region soil water from hillslopes appears to have an immediate effect on the shape of the stormflow hydrograph, its role at this basin is basically restricted to the recharge of the groundwater reservoir in the near-channel area. Storm hydrograph peaks appear to be derived from a small direct runoff component supplemented by a fast delivery of baseflow from the groundwater reservoir in the valley bottom.

2-s2.0-0034670135,"Catastrophic winds from tornadoes and downbursts are a major cause of natural disturbance in forests of eastern North America, accounting for thousands of hectares of disturbed area annually. Wind disturbance shows substantial regional variation, decreasing from the mid-west to the east and from the south-east to New England. In terms of the relative importance among these types of storms, more forest damage results from tornadoes in the south-east and mid-west, while downbursts are the most important type of wind disturbance in the Great Lakes area. Downbursts vary widely in size, but large ones can damage thousands of hectares, while tornadoes are much smaller, seldom affecting more than several hundred hectares. Tornadoes cause the most severe wind disturbances. Site characteristics such as physiography, soil moisture, and soil depth stand characteristics like density and canopy roughness and tree characteristics such as size, species, rooting depth, and wood strength, are the factors most recognized as influencing damage patterns. The consequences of wind damage to forests, such as change in environmental conditions, density, size structure, species composition, and successional status, occur on both immediate hours-to-days and long-term months-to-decades time scales. Most wind disturbances result in the post-disturbance vegetation being comprised of surviving canopy trees, and varying amounts of sprouts, released understory stems, and new seedlings. Stand size structure is usually reduced, and successional status of a forest is often advanced. Diversity can be either increased or decreased, depending on the measure of abundance used to calculate diversity. Because tornadoes and downbursts are in part products of thermodynamic climatic circumstances, they may be affected by anticipated changes in climatic conditions as the st century progresses. However, the current understanding of tornado and downburst formation from supercell storms is very incomplete, and climate-change model predictions sufficiently coarse, that predictions of changes in frequency, size, intensity, or timing of these extreme events must be regarded as highly uncertain. Moreover, retrospective approaches that employ tree demography and dendrochronology require prohibitively large sample sizes to resolve details of the relationship between climate fluctuations and characteristics of these storms. To improve predictions of changes in the climatology of these storms, we need improved understanding of the genesis of tornadoes and downbursts within thunderstorms, and greater resolution in global climate models. To improve coping strategies, forest scientists can contribute by giving more attention to how various silvicultural actions influence stand and tree vulnerability. Finally, increased focus on the dynamics of forest recovery and regrowth may suggest management actions that can facilitate desired objectives after one of these unpredictable wind disturbances.

The model has been adapted for the two species using estimates of maximum resistive bending moment from historical tree winching studies performed in the two regions, drag coefficients obtained from wind tunnel tests, and wind data from representative meteorological stations. The risk is calculated as the probability that the threshold wind speed for damage will be exceeded at a particular site. This approach enables the effect of different growth rates, soil types, management regimes and wind climates to be investigated. The threshold wind speed for tree failure was calculated for stands of both species grown under standard regimes on typical soils and characteristic topography. The probability that the threshold wind speed is exceeded was determined using a recurrence function fitted to time-series of annual maximum hourly wind speeds from a representative long-term meteorological station for each region. The two species are grown over substantially different rotation lengths, so comparisons were made between the profile of risk over a single rotation, and also as cumulative risk over a time-span sufficient to contain multiple rotations. The results demonstrate substantial differences in the probability of wind damage between forests in the two regions as they are currently managed. Contrary to expectation, the risk is lowest for forests in the region of the most severe wind climate, because of the selection of a risk-minimising strategy. This finding emphasises the degree to which management of forests can affect the frequency and amount of damage that they experience.

Ice damage in these topographic positions removed approximately 30% to 60% of total basal area and created large canopy openings. Several processes may have contributed to topographic variations in ice accretion, including orographic effects on rainfall and influences of wind on twig surface and raindrop thermodynamics. © 1999 by V.

Undisturbed field- and bottom-layer vegetation had effectively hindered tree seedling establishment, which emphasises the role of soil disturbance for regeneration. While the establishment of seedlings was found to be clearly determined by the availability of favourable regeneration microhabitats, the early growth of seedlings was affected by a complex interaction of environmental variables, including the type of microhabitat, radiation environment and interferences caused by competing seedlings and adjacent trees. In the most important regeneration microhabitats, i.e. in uprooting pits and on mounds, the distributions of the local elevations of Pinus and Betula seedlings were different. Pinus seedlings occurred closer to ground level, i.e. on the fringes of pits and lower on mounds, while Betula seedlings grew deeper in pits and higher on mounds. The position of the Betula seedlings indicate that they may have a competitive advantage over Pinus seedlings in the dense seedling groups occurring in uprooting spots. We suggest that this initial difference in Pinus and Betula establishment may affect the subsequent within-gap tree species succession and can, in part, explain the general occurrence of Betula in conifer-dominated boreal forests.Seedling establishment in relation to microhabitat variation in a windthrow gap in a boreal Pinus sylvestris forest",Seedling establishment in relation to microhabitat variation in a windthrow gap in a boreal Pinus sylvestris forest,"The characteristics of microhabitats of established Pinus sylvestris and Betula seedlings were studied in a small windthrow gap in a mature P. sylvestris-dominated forest in the Petkeljarvi National Park in eastern Finland.

Catastrophic wind produces a range of gaps from the size caused by individual treefalls to much larger areas. The spatial pattern of damage is influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors. Biotic factors that influence severity of damage include stem size, species, stand conditions canopy structure, density, and the presence of pathogens. Abiotic factors that influence severity of damage include the intensity of the wind, previous disturbance, topography, and soil characteristics.

Recovery is influenced also by frequency of wind disturbance, which varies across geographical regions.
